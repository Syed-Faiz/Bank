<h1>What Is a Bank :</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and
			make loans. Banks may also provide financial services such as wealth
			management, currency exchange, and safe deposit boxes. There are
			several different kinds of banks including retail banks, commercial
			or corporate banks, and investment banks. In most countries, banks
			are regulated by the national government or central bank. KEY
			TAKEAWAYS A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive
			deposits and make loans. There are several types of banks including
			retail, commercial, and investment banks. In most countries, banks
			are regulated by the national government or central bank.
			Understanding Banks Banks are a very important part of the economy
			because they provide vital services for both consumers and
			businesses. As financial services providers, they give you a safe
			place to store your cash. Through a variety of account types such as
			checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs), you
			can conduct routine banking transactions like deposits, withdrawals,
			check writing, and bill payments. You can also save your money and
			earn interest on your investment. The money stored in most bank
			accounts is federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
			Corporation (FDIC), up to a limit of $250,000 for individual
			depositors and $500,000 for jointly held deposits.1 Banks also
			provide credit opportunities for people and corporations. The bank
			lends the money you deposit at the bank—short-term cash—to others for
			long-term debt such as car loans, credit cards, mortgages, and other
			debt vehicles. This process helps create liquidity in the
			market—which creates money and keeps the supply going.</h2>
